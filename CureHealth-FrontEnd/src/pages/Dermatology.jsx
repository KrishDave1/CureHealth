          How CureHealth Dermatology works?
        </h1>
        <p className='text-xl p-4 font-light'>
          Dermatologists can care for most common skin, hair, and nail issues by
          seeing photos and a description of the condition. You will answer a
          few basic questions, provide a brief medical history, describe your
          symptoms, and upload photos of the condition you are seeking treatment
          for. Within 72 hours and usually within 24 hours you are notified of
          your diagnosis and treatment plan from a board-certified
          dermatologist. Prescriptions, if appropriate, will be sent to your
          preferred pharmacy.
        </p>
        {/* <br /> */}
        <p className='text-xl p-4 font-light'>
          In addition, you may submit a message to your dermatologist for up to
          30 days after your appointment through the portal if you have an
          additional question or comment at no additional cost.
